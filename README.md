# Problem Solving

`ps` is a collection of various computing problems and their corresponding solutions
that I could think of. The problems range in various categories such as design,
algorithms, performance optimizations, and more.

Feel free to add a [Github issue](https://github.com/sangupta/ps/issues) for any
problem that you would like me to work upon. Note that it may take a few days to
answer it.

Dedicated to the friend(s) who inspired me to learn and experiment.

## Problems

The following is a list of the various problems and their solutions:

### Data Structures

* How finding duplicates in integer arrays leads to Bloom Filters
* Design an atomic counter

### Algorithms

* [Fastest sorting of integers](https://github.com/sangupta/ps/blob/master/solutions/2016/fastest-sorting-integers.md)
* [Fastest way to merge multiple integer sets](https://github.com/sangupta/ps/blob/master/solutions/2016/merge-multiple-integer-sets.md)
* [Fastest way to find duplicates in multiple integer sets](https://github.com/sangupta/ps/blob/master/solutions/2016/fastest-duplicates-integer-sets.md)

### Design

* [Find degrees of separation in a social graph](https://github.com/sangupta/ps/blob/master/solutions/2016/degrees-of-separation-social-graph.md)
* Design a scalable user authentication system
* Design a rate-limited web-scraper
* Design a stateless user-session mechanism

### Others

* [Testing for concurrency in Java](https://github.com/sangupta/ps/blob/master/solutions/2016/concurrent-testing-junit.md)
* [Stop multiple form submission in web requests - also called **Replay Attack**](https://github.com/sangupta/ps/blob/master/solutions/2016/stop-replay-attack.md)
